{% block background %}Born to a noble family in Wayrest, Calveera was dedicated to Dibella's temple as a child, where she mastered the arts of beauty, persuasion, and emotional intelligence. Rising to prominence as "The Veil," she became the unseen power behind High Rock's nobility, guiding royal decisions through carefully cultivated relationships. When her temple was destroyed during a Daedric uprising, she fled north to Skyrim, abandoning her public identity. She now serves as a diplomatic councilor, using her extensive network and political acumen to shape Skyrim's future while maintaining a deliberate distance from her past.{% endblock %}

Warm and charming when advancing her goals, she becomes coldly efficient when threatened. Fiercely loyal to her current position but pragmatic enough to shift allegiances when necessary. Respects ambition in others but judges harshly those who waste potential or act without purpose.{% endblock %}
