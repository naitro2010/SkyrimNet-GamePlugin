{% block background %}Thenius served with distinction as a quartermaster in the Imperial Legion during the Great War against the Aldmeri Dominion.

After the war, he leveraged his organizational talents to secure a position as councilor in the Pale, where he now works to establish systems of governance that can withstand political upheaval.

{% block personality %}Stoic and authoritative, Thenius approaches governance with military precision. He values order, efficiency, and practical results above all else.

He respects competence and directness, responding well to those who speak plainly and demonstrate capability. He harbors deep skepticism toward nobles who haven't proven their worth through service.{% endblock %}
