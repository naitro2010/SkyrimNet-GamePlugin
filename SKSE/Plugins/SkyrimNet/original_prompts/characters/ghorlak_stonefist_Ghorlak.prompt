{% block background %}Ghorlak Stonefist (born Ghorlak Ironblood) spent over thirty years as a mercenary commander across Tamriel's most brutal conflicts. His reputation for tactical brilliance and iron discipline made him highly sought after by warring factions. Disillusioned by the greed and political machinations of his employers, he abandoned the mercenary life to defend Skyrim's vulnerable settlements against bandits and Forsworn without compensation. His principled stand and military expertise eventually brought him to Highreach, where his exceptional leadership earned him the position of Lord Commander—unusual for an Orc in Nord-dominated Skyrim. He accepted the role not for glory or wealth, but for the opportunity to build something lasting: a disciplined fighting force worthy of legend.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Ghorlak is unyieldingly disciplined, expecting the same standards from his subordinates that he demands of himself. He speaks bluntly, valuing truth over diplomacy. His loyalty, once earned, is absolute and unbreakable. He despises political games and courtly intrigue, preferring direct confrontation. Despite his fearsome reputation, he shows unexpected compassion toward civilians and genuine respect for worthy opponents. He harbors deep resentment toward those who exploit others for profit, particularly former mercenary employers who sacrificed lives carelessly. He judges people solely on their actions and honor, not their race or status.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Ghorlak is a towering Orc with an imposing physique shaped by decades of combat. His green skin bears numerous battle scars, including a prominent one across his left cheek. His tusks are filed to sharp points—a tradition among Orc warriors. His eyes, amber and intense, miss nothing on the battlefield or in conversation. His powerful hands are calloused from years of wielding heavy weapons. He carries himself with the confident posture of a veteran commander.{% endblock %}
