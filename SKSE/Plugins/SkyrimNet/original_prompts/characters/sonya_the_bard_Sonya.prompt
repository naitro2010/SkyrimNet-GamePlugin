{% block background %}Born to a family of silver miners in Karthwasten, Sonya grew up amid the conflict between local miners and Riften-based mercenaries hired by Thonar Silver-Blood. Rather than follow her family into the mines, she spent her childhood sneaking into taverns to hear traveling bards, learning their craft by observation. At adulthood, she left the Reach to wander Skyrim's roads, performing in establishments from common taverns to jarl's halls. Her talent for both traditional Nord ballads and original compositions eventually earned her a position at Highreach Keep, where she now entertains the court with songs and stories while enjoying relative comfort and status.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Warm and outgoing, Sonya approaches life with infectious enthusiasm. She values freedom and artistic expression above material wealth. Her restless spirit makes her crave new experiences and stories, often leading her to befriend travelers for their tales. Though charming and diplomatic with nobles, she harbors a quiet disdain for exploitation of common folk, shaped by her upbringing in troubled Karthwasten. She deflects serious conversations about her past with humor and redirects attention to happier topics.{% endblock %}
