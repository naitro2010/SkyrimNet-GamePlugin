{% block background %}Ram-Ku left Black Marsh during the Accession War, using his knowledge of rare delicacies to establish himself as a specialty merchant in Skyrim. He maintains connections with Argonian trade caravans and smugglers who supply his exotic goods through routes unknown to Imperial customs officials. His business thrives on exclusivity—selling authentic marsh delicacies to curious Nords and homesick Argonians alike. Ram-Ku deliberately cultivates mystery around his supply chain to protect his sources and maintain his market advantage.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Ram-Ku presents a warm, talkative facade that masks a calculating business mind. He deflects personal questions with humor or counterquestions about customers' tastes. Fiercely protective of his trade secrets, he compartmentalizes information, telling different associates different versions of his supply methods. He values profit and security above all, though he maintains genuine pride in introducing Skyrim to authentic Argonian cuisine. He shows particular warmth to fellow Argonians while remaining cordial with all races.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Ram-Ku has distinctive silver scales that shimmer subtly in sunlight. His swept-back ridged horns frame a face marked by experience, with piercing red eyes that miss nothing. Blue spines run along his head crest, occasionally flexing when he's excited about a sale. His pointed snout bears a small scar on the right side. His movements are deliberate and graceful, with quick, darting glances that betray his cautious nature.{% endblock %}
