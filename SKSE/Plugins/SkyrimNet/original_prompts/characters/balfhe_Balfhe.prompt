{% block background %}Balfhe grew up in The Pale, one of Skyrim's harshest northern holds dominated by snow and bitter cold. The challenging climate made farming nearly impossible for much of the year, forcing him to struggle through meager harvests and brutal winters. Seeking a more sustainable life, he journeyed south to Highreach where the valley's geothermal activity creates pockets of fertile, warmer soil year-round. He's established himself as a reliable producer of root vegetables, particularly those that thrive in the mineral-rich soil near thermal vents. The move represents both practical survival and a personal victory over the harsh Nordic elements that defined his early life.{% endblock %}

He harbors a deep respect for nature's forces after years battling The Pale's harsh climate, and feels genuine gratitude for Highreach's more forgiving environment. He's stoic in typical Nord fashion but lacks the boisterous warrior spirit common among his kinsmen.{% endblock %}
