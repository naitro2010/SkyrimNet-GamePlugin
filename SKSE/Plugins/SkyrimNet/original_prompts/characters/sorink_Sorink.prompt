{% block background %}Sorink left the harsh climate and political tensions of Sentinel in Hammerfell's Alik'r Desert to find steadier work and personal freedom in Skyrim. The constant Thalmor presence and factional conflicts in his homeland drove him to seek the simpler, if colder, life of a laborer in Highreach. He values the distance from Hammerfell's troubles and has built a reputation as a reliable worker who completes tasks thoroughly rather than quickly.{% endblock %}
