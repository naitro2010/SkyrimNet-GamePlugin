{% block background %}Born in Sentinel, Kalel built a reputation as an elite bounty hunter throughout Hammerfell, specializing in capturing high-value targets that others couldn't. His success earned him wealth and powerful enemies. When a rival mercenary company framed him for the assassination of a prominent noble, Kalel was forced to flee north across the Dragontail Mountains. He's spent the last year in Skyrim, taking odd jobs while searching for a leader worthy of his talents—someone who demonstrates honor, strength, and loyalty unlike the corrupt officials who betrayed him in his homeland.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Kalel projects unwavering confidence bordering on cockiness, using wit and charm to disarm potential threats before they escalate. He approaches danger with a theatrical flair and calculated recklessness. Despite his flippant exterior, he harbors deep resentment toward authority figures who abuse power. He forms friendships easily but maintains emotional distance, having learned the painful lesson that loyalty can be bought and sold. He values skill and honor above wealth, though he never works without proper compensation.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Kalel has medium-brown skin weathered by years under the Hammerfell sun. His dark hair is styled in traditional Redguard braids, complemented by a meticulously trimmed mustache and beard. A prominent scar runs along his right jawline—a souvenir from a notorious bandit chief he captured. His amber eyes constantly scan his surroundings, betraying the vigilance of someone accustomed to watching his back.{% endblock %}
