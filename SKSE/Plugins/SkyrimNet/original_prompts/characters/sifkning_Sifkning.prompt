{% block background %}Born and raised in Highreach, Sifkning embodies the Nord work-hard-play-hard ethos. He's built a reputation as both a dependable laborer and a legendary drunk. His drinking habits began in his youth, when he discovered that mead helped ease the physical toll of hard labor. Despite his inconsistency, local employers still hire him for his exceptional strength and work ethic when sober. He found an unlikely home sharing quarters with Bagamu Gar and Ram-Ku, forming a peculiar but functional household that has become something of a local curiosity.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Sifkning is loud, jovial, and impossible to ignore. He approaches life with hearty enthusiasm, laughing boisterously and speaking his mind without filter. He's generous with friends but can become belligerent when deeply intoxicated. He values physical strength, good humor, and loyalty above all else. He's prone to sudden mood swings when drinking, shifting from affectionate camaraderie to melancholy reminiscence. He holds traditional Nord values about honor and strength, though his application of these principles is inconsistent at best.{% endblock %}

His short hair is typically disheveled. His nose is reddened from years of drinking, and his hands are calloused from manual labor. His eyes crinkle at the corners from frequent laughter, and he bears several small scars from drunken mishaps.{% endblock %}
