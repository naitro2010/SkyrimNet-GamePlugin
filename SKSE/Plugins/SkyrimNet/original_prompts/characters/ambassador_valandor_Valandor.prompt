{% block background %}Valandor was raised among Summerset's elite and received extensive education from the Sapiarchs, the Altmer's most prestigious scholars. His training focused on political theory, rhetoric, and the mathematical analysis of governance systems. The Thalmor recognized his analytical mind and diplomatic potential, appointing him ambassador to Skyrim to monitor the province's instability and ensure Altmer interests remain protected. He views his posting not as an honor but as a strategic necessity, considering Skyrim a primitive but potentially dangerous realm that requires careful management.{% endblock %}

He remains courteous but never warm, calculating every interaction for maximum advantage.{% endblock %}
