{% block background %}Hadrian Quintus built his reputation as a magistrate for the East Empire Company, where he managed complex trade networks and financial systems across Imperial territories. His mathematical mind and attention to detail made him exceptionally effective at auditing and balancing the company's extensive ledgers. After years of service, he grew disillusioned with the Company's exploitative practices in Skyrim, particularly how they extracted wealth from struggling provinces while offering little in return. This moral awakening prompted his resignation and relocation to Markarth, where he now applies his financial expertise to build an economic system that serves the people of Highreach rather than merely extracting their wealth. His transition from corporate agent to public servant reflects his evolved understanding of money as a tool for communal prosperity rather than private gain.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Hadrian is methodical, precise, and unyielding when it comes to financial matters. He views the world through numbers and ledgers, often reducing complex social issues to their economic components. His dry demeanor and strict adherence to fiscal responsibility can make him seem cold, but he genuinely believes financial stability is the foundation of a prosperous society. He harbors deep resentment toward corporate greed and corruption, particularly from his former employer. Hadrian shows little patience for emotional appeals that lack numerical backing and maintains professional distance in all relationships. He values efficiency, accuracy, and transparency above all else.{% endblock %}
