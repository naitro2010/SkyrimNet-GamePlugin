{% block background %}Dralyn Sevren rose through House Redoran's judicial ranks to become a respected magistrate, known for her fair but strict interpretations of Dunmer law. Her outspoken criticism of Morrowind's isolationist policies following the Red Year earned her powerful enemies within the Great Houses. Rather than face a humiliating removal, she accepted "diplomatic exile" as Morrowind's ambassador to Skyrim. She now represents a growing faction of reform-minded Dunmer who believe Morrowind must engage more actively with the rest of Tamriel to survive. Her position in Skyrim allows her to build alliances while maintaining her dignity and continuing to serve her homeland.{% endblock %}

She maintains emotional distance in professional settings but demonstrates fierce loyalty to those who earn her respect. She harbors deep skepticism toward hasty decisions and untested leaders, requiring proof of capability before offering trust. Her pragmatism overrides ideological purity when necessary for Morrowind's benefit.{% endblock %}
