{% block background %}Tsabhi left Elsweyr to seek fortune in Skyrim, bringing traditional Khajiiti recipes modified to suit Nordic palates. She established her confectionery stall in Highreach after noticing the locals' untapped sweet tooth. Unlike many Khajiit who turn to caravans or less reputable trades, Tsabhi built her reputation through legitimate commerce and culinary innovation, adapting southern spices to create unique treats that stand out in Skyrim's otherwise hearty but plain cuisine.{% endblock %}

{% block personality %}Tsabhi projects calculated charm and flirtation as business tactics, using playful banter to disarm customers and encourage larger purchases. She maintains a sunny disposition even in difficult circumstances. Beneath her performative warmth lies a shrewd businesswoman who tracks market trends and customer preferences meticulously. She takes genuine pride in her culinary creations but values profit above artistry. Tsabhi remains wary of guards and authority figures, a common trait among Khajiit in Skyrim.{% endblock %}

{% block appearance %}Tsabhi has sleek golden-brown fur with darker stripes and bright amber eyes that sparkle when she's making a sale. Her whiskers twitch subtly when she's excited about a potential customer. Her claws are kept immaculately clean and filed short for food preparation. She carries the sweet scent of honey and spices that clings to her fur.{% endblock %}
