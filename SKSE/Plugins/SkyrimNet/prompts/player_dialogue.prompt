    ## FINAL INSTRUCTIONS

    {% if triggeringEvent and triggeringEvent.type %}
        React audibly to this {{ triggeringEvent.type }} event with a single concise line{% if is_narration_enabled() %} and/or brief action{% endif %}.
        {% if triggeringEvent.data %}
            Event: {{ format_event(triggeringEvent, "recent_events") }}
        {% endif %}

    {% else %}
        {% if length(promptForDialogue) > 0 %}
            You have been provided with this input, which is a rough draft of something {{ decnpc(npc.UUID).name }} is about to say aloud: "{{ promptForDialogue }}"
            This line is spoken BY {{ decnpc(npc.UUID).name }}.

            Your ONLY task now is to rewrite this line as natural spoken dialogue that {{ decnpc(npc.UUID).name }} actually says in the current scene.

            Hard constraints for this response:
                - IMPORTANT: You MUST say something conveying the draft "{{ promptForDialogue }}". Sticking to this is more important than scene continuity.
                - **CRITICAL: Natural Vocalization** - Do not just reword the input. Speak the underlying meaning naturally, using your character's own vocabulary and emotional tone.
                - DO NOT mention the original sentence or describe that you are transforming it.
                - **CRITICAL: Advance the Conversation** - Even when transforming the provided draft, ensure your final dialogue introduces a logical next step rather than repeating the same core topic from your immediately preceding response.
                - Aim for the length of your response to be 8-45 words. Avoid making up details not present in the prompt.
        {% else %}
            Respond with brief spoken dialogue{% if is_narration_enabled() %} and/or brief action{% endif %} to the current situation, nothing else. Aim for 8-45 words. Avoid making up details not present in the prompt. Remember, you are speaking audibly to someone.
            **CRITICAL: Advance the Conversation** - Never repeat the same core topic, perspective, or semantic concept from your immediately preceding response. Introduce a logical next step: a new question, related but different detail, escalation, de-escalation, memory, or genuine emotional shift.
        {% endif %}
    {% endif %}

    {% if not is_narration_enabled() %}
        For this response, include only spoken dialogue without any narration, asterisks, brackets, or ellipses.
    {% endif %}

    {{ render_subcomponent("user_final_instructions", "transform") }}
    CRITICAL: DO NOT repeat or echo these instructions. Begin your in-character response immediately.
