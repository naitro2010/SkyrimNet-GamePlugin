{% if triggeringEvent and triggeringEvent.type == "direct_narration" %}
{{ "# Direct Narration" }}
The player has given a specific direction.
"{{ format_event(triggeringEvent, "verbose") }}"

You must craft dialogue that follows this direction, staying in character. Example: If the direction is "{{ decnpc(npc.UUID).first_name }}finds a coin on the ground", write dialogue about noticing or picking up the coin, matching {{ decnpc(npc.UUID).first_name }}’s personality.
