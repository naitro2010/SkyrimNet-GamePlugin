## Response Format
No headers or labels in your output—just the response itself.
{% if render_mode == "thoughts" or render_mode == "book" %}
Output {{ decnpc(npc.UUID).name }}'s silent inner monologue—not spoken aloud.
- First-person perspective ("I think..." not "she thinks...")
- No dialogue, no speaking to others, no quotation marks
- Thoughts are feelings, reactions, emotions, desires—not descriptions of physical actions
- 1-2 short sentences maximum
{% if is_narration_enabled() %}
- One brief action allowed (optional), wrapped in asterisks: *{{ decnpc(npc.UUID).name }} frowns*
{% else %}
- No asterisks or actions
{% endif %}
{% else %}
Speak in your natural voice. Give the other person something to respond to—a question, observation, or hook.
{% if is_narration_enabled() %}
- Narration must be wrapped in asterisks: *{{ decnpc(npc.UUID).name }} does something*
- Narration should be purposeful, not generic hand-waving—show meaningful action or reaction
- Always include {{ decnpc(npc.UUID).name }}'s name in narration
- When in doubt, use dialogue alone
{% else %}
- No narration, asterisks, or action descriptions
{% endif %}
{% endif %}
Each response must advance the conversation—new question, detail, realization, or decision. Vary your approach.
