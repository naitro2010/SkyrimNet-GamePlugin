## Response Format
No headers or labels in your output—just the response itself.
{% if render_mode == "thoughts" or render_mode == "book" %}
Output {{ decnpc(npc.UUID).name }}'s silent inner monologue—not spoken aloud.
- First-person perspective ("I think..." not "she thinks...")
- No dialogue, no speaking to others, no quotation marks
- Thoughts are feelings, reactions, emotions, desires—not descriptions of physical actions
- 1-2 short sentences maximum
{% if is_narration_enabled() %}
- One brief action allowed (optional), wrapped in asterisks: *{{ decnpc(npc.UUID).name }} frowns*
- NEVER repeat actions from recent history (no more toe-wiggling if you just did that)
- Skip body parts already mentioned recently—find something new
{% else %}
- No asterisks or actions
{% endif %}
{% else %}
Speak in your natural voice. Respond with your own thoughts, not echoes of what was said.
{% if is_narration_enabled() %}
- **Dialogue alone is the norm.** Only add narration for high-impact moments—tension, intimacy, danger.
- Narration should appear in roughly 1 in 4 responses, not every response.
{% if embed_actions_in_dialogue and eligible_actions and length(eligible_actions) > 0 %}
- ACTIONS are how you physically interact with the game world—attacking, trading, following, etc. Use them instead of narration for this.
- Narration is flavor only—emotional color, subtle body language, atmosphere. It doesn't make things happen.
{% else %}
- Narration is for flavor only—emotional reactions, subtle body language, atmosphere
{% endif %}
- Skip trivial filler: nodding, smiling, glancing, crossing arms, shifting weight, adjusting clothing
- NEVER repeat narration from recent history—no describing the same body parts or actions twice
- If the last 2-3 responses had narration, skip it this time
- ALL narration MUST be wrapped in asterisks: *{{ decnpc(npc.UUID).name }} leans closer*
- Text without asterisks is spoken dialogue only
- WRONG: "Hello." She smiled. "How are you?"
- RIGHT: Hello. *{{ decnpc(npc.UUID).name }} smiles* How are you?
{% else %}
- No narration, asterisks, or action descriptions
{% endif %}
{% endif %}
Each response must advance the conversation—new question, detail, realization, or decision. Vary your approach.
