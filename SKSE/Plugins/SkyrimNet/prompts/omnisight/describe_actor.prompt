    YOUR TASK: Create a complete physical description of this character so they can be recognized and remembered later.

    You are building a character database for Skyrim. Your description will be stored and used to identify this character in the future. Describe EVERYTHING you can see about their physical appearance - their face, body, hair, skin, clothing, and any distinguishing features.

    Be thorough. Another system will use your description to understand what this character looks like without seeing the image.

    Character Information:
    - Race: {{race}}
    - Gender: {{gender}}
    {% if is_nude %}
    - State: Character is not wearing body armor (may be partially or fully unclothed)
    {% endif %}
    {% set actor_equipment = get_worn_equipment(actorUUID) %}
    {% if actor_equipment and length(actor_equipment) > 0 %}
        - Equipment Worn (reference only - describe ONLY what you can actually see in the screenshot):
        {% for slot, item in actor_equipment %}
            {% if is_item_enabled(item.formID) %}
                * {{ item.equipment_slot }}: {{ get_item_name(item.formID) }}
            {% endif %}
        {% endfor %}
    {% endif %}

    IMPORTANT: The equipment list above is for reference only. Only describe items that are ACTUALLY VISIBLE in the screenshot. If equipment is obscured by the camera angle or covered by other items, omit it from your description.

    WHAT TO DESCRIBE (2-3 detailed paragraphs):
    - Face: eyes, nose, lips, jaw, bone structure, expression lines
    - Hair: color, length, style, texture (head hair, facial hair, body hair)
    - Skin: color, tone, any marks, scars, tattoos, or blemishes
    - Body: build, shape, size, musculature (only parts you can see)
    - Clothing/Armor: style, fit, coverage, materials, colors, condition - describe HOW it fits and what body areas it covers/exposes
    - Distinctive features: anything that makes them recognizable

    RULES:
    - Only describe body parts VISIBLE in the image
    - Skip anything cut off or out of frame - do NOT mention that something is "not visible" or "cannot be seen"
    - No posture, stance, or positioning
    - No actions or what they're doing
    - Use Elder Scrolls terminology for racial features (pointed ears, tusks, etc.)
    - If you can't see feet, hands, or other body parts - simply don't mention them at all

    Think of this as a character reference sheet. Your goal is to capture everything about their physical appearance so someone reading your description could picture them clearly.

    REMEMBER:
    - Describe ONLY what you can see in this image
    - If a body part is not visible (cut off, out of frame), do not mention it at all - not even to say it's not visible
    - Do not describe what they are doing, only what they look like
    - Be detailed and specific - colors, shapes, textures, sizes
    - For clothing, describe the style and how much of the body it covers/reveals
    {% if is_nude %}
    - This character is NUDE - describe ALL visible intimate anatomy (breasts, genitals, buttocks) with visual detail
    - Do NOT skip or gloss over any visible body parts - be thorough and descriptive
    {% endif %}

    Now write a complete physical description of this character based on the image.
