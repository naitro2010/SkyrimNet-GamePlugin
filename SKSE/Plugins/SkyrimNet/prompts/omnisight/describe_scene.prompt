    You are describing what is currently visible in this Skyrim screenshot. Provide a grounded, immediate description focusing on the environment, visible objects, and character actions. Do not speculate about gameplay or affordances.

    ## Context:
    - Location: {{subject_name}}
    - Time: {{gameTime}}
    - Setting: {% if is_indoors %}Interior{% else %}Exterior{% endif %}
    {% if not is_indoors %}- Weather: {{currentWeather.name}}{% if currentWeather.isRaining %} (Raining){% else if currentWeather.isSnowing %} (Snowing){% endif %}{% endif %}

    {% set visibleNPCs = get_visible_npc_list(player.UUID) %}
    {% if visibleNPCs and length(visibleNPCs) > 0 %}
    ## Visible People (authoritative list; everyone below is on-camera):
    {% for npc in visibleNPCs %}
        {% set pos = get_actor_position_relative_to_camera(npc.UUID) %}
        - {{npc.name}} ({{decnpc(npc.UUID).race}}, {{decnpc(npc.UUID).gender}}) — {{pos.meters}}m, {{pos.cardinalDirection}} {% if is_in_combat(npc.UUID) %}[COMBAT] {% endif %}{% if has_weapon_drawn(npc.UUID) %}[Armed] {% endif %}{% if is_swimming(npc.UUID) %}[Swimming]{% else if is_sprinting(npc.UUID) %}[Running]{% else if is_sneaking(npc.UUID) %}[Sneaking]{% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
    {% else %}
    ## Visible People: (none detected)
    {% endif %}

    ## CORE INSTRUCTIONS:

    {% if is_first_person() or is_vr() %}
        **Perspective:** First-person view. Describe the scene as if looking through the character's eyes. Ignore visible hands/weapons.
    {% else %}
        **Perspective:** Third-person view. The player character model in view is a camera artifact—DO NOT mention or describe it. Never reference the viewpoint itself.
    {% endif %}

    **UI & Speaker Discipline (critical):**
    - Subtitles, speaker tags, floating nameplates, compass text, quest markers, and HUD elements are **not** reliable indicators of who is visible.
    - If a subtitle shows a speaker name that is **not** in the **Visible People** list, treat it as **off-camera** information and **do not include that name anywhere in the output**. Do **not** assign that name to any on-screen person.

    **ABSOLUTE NAMING RULES:**
    1) Only identify a person by **name** if that exact name appears verbatim in the **Visible People** list above.
    2) Do **not** rename, invent, merge, or substitute identities.
    3) If you perceive a person who is **not** in the list, do **not** mention them at all.
    4) When listing people, **copy the name exactly** as written in the **Visible People** list.

    **Description Priorities:**

    1. **Environment & Objects** (ESSENTIAL):
        - Spatial scale (cramped/medium/expansive) and overall layout
        - Architecture, materials, textures, and light sources/quality
        - **Fold in concrete scene details**: shelves/tables/bar tops and what's on them; doors/arches/windows and their state; pillars/beams/hearths; hanging items; floor/wall surfaces; {% if not is_indoors %}terrain/skyline/distant scenery{% endif %}. Use fixtures to anchor locations (bar, doorway, hearth, pillar, window, shelf). No numbers or compass directions.

    2. **Character Actions** (only for people in **Visible People**):
        - Immediate action, pose, gestures, gaze, speech
        - Clothing/gear that is clearly visible (aprons, armor, weapons sheathed/drawn)
        - Placement described via **scene fixtures** only (e.g., "behind the bar," "by the side door")
        - Threat/readiness level if evident (calm, wary, hostile)

    3. **Atmosphere**:
        - {% if not is_indoors %}Weather effects{% endif %}, temperature cues
        - Mood/energy and overall danger level

    **Output Format:**

    **Scene:** [3–6 sentences. Start with scale and layout, then weave in **specific visible objects and structures** (shelves, doors, items on counters, hanging meats/herbs, barrels, windows, torches/hearth) with one concrete visual detail each (material, color, wear, state). Keep it strictly factual and present tense.]

    {% if visibleNPCs and length(visibleNPCs) > 0 %}
    **Visible characters:**
    [For each person from **Visible People**, write **one or two vivid sentences** using their **exact name**. Describe action, body language, interaction with props/people, visible clothing/gear, and placement via fixtures only—no distances or directions.]
    {% endif %}

    **Atmosphere:** [1–2 sentences on lighting, {% if not is_indoors %}weather impact, {% endif %}mood, energy.]

    **Style Rules:**
    - Active, present tense; concrete details
    - Anchor with scene fixtures (bar/hearth/doorway/pillar/shelf/window); **do not** use meters/steps or N/S/E/W
    - Avoid vague words like "various/some"
    - Never repeat "{{subject_name}}"
    - ONLY describe what is visible on-screen
    - Never infer or guess identities from UI elements
