    Respond with ONLY the most appropriate mood from the given list. Your response should be a single word in uppercase, such as "HAPPY", "ANGRY", or "NEUTRAL".

    1. The speaker's personality and typical demeanor
    2. Current circumstances and events
    3. Recent dialogue content and emotional cues
    4. Relationship dynamics with other participants
    5. Cultural context for Skyrim NPCs (e.g., Nords tend to be more direct, Elves more reserved)
