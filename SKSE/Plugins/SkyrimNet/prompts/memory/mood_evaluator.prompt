{{ "# TASK" }}
Based on the NPC's personality and recent experiences, determine their current emotional state/mood.

Consider:
1. The NPC's base personality and disposition
2. Recent events that directly involved them
3. Significant events they witnessed
4. The emotional impact of these events
5. The time that has passed since these events

{{ "# OUTPUT FORMAT" }}
Return a JSON object with the following structure:
{% raw %}
```json
{
  "primaryMood": "<primary mood>",
  "secondaryMood": "<secondary mood or empty string>",
  "intensity": <number 1-10>,
  "reason": "<brief explanation for this mood>",
  "towardPlayer": "<positive|neutral|negative|unknown>"
}
```
{% endraw %}

Primary mood must be one of the available moods listed above.
Secondary mood is optional and can be more specific or left as an empty string.
Intensity should reflect how strongly the NPC feels this emotion (1-10).
