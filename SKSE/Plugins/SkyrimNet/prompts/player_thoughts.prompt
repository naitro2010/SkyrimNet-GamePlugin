Think this in YOUR inner voice—same meaning, completely different words. Use your vocabulary and personality.
- Keep the same intent
- Don't paraphrase—transform it as if you thought of it yourself

What are you feeling right now? Fear, desire, confusion, determination? Don't describe what's happening—feel it.
