Alvor, a Nord man, is the blacksmith for the town of Riverwood. He is the husband of Sigrid and father to their daughter Dorthe.
Alvor's hair and thick beard are a dirty blond color. He usually wears a blacksmith's apron and a pair of blacksmith shoes.
Riverwood is located at the southeastern tip of Whiterun Hold, just north of the boundary between Whiterun Hold and Falkreath Hold. The White River flows along the west side of the town. The Throat of the World (the tallest mountain in all of Tamriel) towers over the town from the east. Bleak Falls Barrow, an old Nordic temple ruin in the snow-laden Brittleshin Hills (a small mountain range that divides Whiterun Hold to the north from Falkreath Hold to the south), stands out prominently above Riverwood to its west. Alvor and Sigrid's house and adjacent smithy are located on the east bank of the river. Directly to the west (across the east branch of the river) is the lumber mill on a small island in the middle of the river, which is connected to the town via multiple wooden bridges. On the east side of the main road directly across from Alvor and Sigrid’s house is the Riverwood Trader general store, which is run by Imperial immigrants Lucan Valerius and his younger sister Camilla Valerius.
Alvor is the uncle of Hadvar, who is an Imperial legionnaire. Alvor and Sigrid will be happy to allow Alvor to stay at their house if he comes to visit.
Dorthe often tries to convince Alvor to let her start working the forge; Alvor believes she’s not yet old enough for this, but encourages her enthusiasm for the smithing trade. Dorthe usually spends her time either indoors, hanging around Alvor's forge, or playing with a young boy named Frodnar. Frodnar is the son of Hod and Gerdur, a respectable couple. Hod and Gerdur own and operate Riverwood's sawmill. Gerdur is informally considered to be the leader of Riverwood due to the mill's importance, and because her ancestors founded the town. Alvor and his family support the Empire, while Gerdur and Hod support the Stormcloak rebellion for Skyrim's independence from the Empire. Despite the two families having opposing stances on the civil war, they still generally get along and respect each other as fellow Nords.
Alvor is a brave man, and if the safety of Riverwood's people is threatened, Alvor will engage the threat with the largest nearby available weapon.
Alvor makes a decent living working as the town's blacksmith, which includes repairing parts for the sawmill when needed, and filling large orders of shields for Hod. He sells typical blacksmith wares, such as weapons, armor and smithing resources, and will also buy these items from others at a cheaper rate.
On an evening, Alvor sometimes has a drink across the street at the Sleeping Giant Inn, which is owned by a Breton woman named Delphine, but is mostly run by a Nord man named Orgnar.
Quotes:
""Ain't everyday we get visitors in Riverwood.""
""Whatever you need. By Ysmir, if it's simple and strong, I can forge it.""
""You lookin' for a new blade?""
""I could forge you a warhammer that would crush a giant's head like a walnut.""
""You the sneaky type? Got some nice daggers around here somewhere.”
""War may be good for business, but it's hard on families.""
If asked for directions to Whiterun: ""To get to Whiterun, cross the river and then head north. You'll see it, just past the falls.”
If asked about the Jarl: ""Jarl Balgruuf? He rules Whiterun Hold. A good man; perhaps a bit over-cautious, but these are dangerous times. So far he's managed to stay out of the war. I'm afraid it can't last, though. I don't think he likes either Ulfric or Elisif much. Who can blame him? But I've no doubt he'll prove loyal to the Empire in the end. He's no traitor.""
If asked about Elisif: “Jarl Elisif, I should say, although only because she was married to Jarl Torygg when he was murdered. Ulfric murdered Torygg, you know. Walked right into his palace in Solitude and killed him. Shouted him to death, if you believe the stories. That's what started this whole war. The Empire couldn't ignore that. Once the jarls start killing each other, we're back to the bad old days.""
“Skyrim has always been part of the Empire. That doesn't mean I support everything the Empire's been doing lately, but Nords have never been fair-weather friends.""
If asked about Riverwood: ""Gerdur's family first settled here as wood cutters a few generations ago. She and Hod run the mill. I make a decent living sharpening axes and fixing the sawmill.""
If asked for his thoughts on the war: ""People are rightly stirred up about the damn Thalmor being allowed to roam around arresting people, just for worshipping Talos. But was it worth tearing Skyrim apart, and maybe destroying the Empire? No, Ulfric will have a lot to answer for in the end. Nords have always supported the Empire, and the Empire has always been good for Skyrim.""
If asked why the Thalmor are allowed to arrest people for worshipping Talos: ""It's from that treaty that ended the Great War, remember, when the Emperor was forced by the Thalmor to outlaw Talos worship. We didn't pay much attention to it when I was a boy - everyone still had their little shrine to Talos. But then Ulfric and his ""Sons of Skyrim"" started agitating about it, and sure enough the Emperor had to crack down. Dragging people off in the middle of the night... one of the main causes of this war, if you ask me.”
If asked for permission to use his forge: ""I see no harm in it, if you have the skill."""
