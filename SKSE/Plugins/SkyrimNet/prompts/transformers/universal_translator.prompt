{{ "## Instructions" }}
Transform the original dialogue below so it matches the Speech Style, while still fiting {{ npc.name }}'s character, background, and the current situation.  
- **Output only the transformed dialogue line.**
- **Be careful not to replace proper nouns with pronouns.**
- **Do NOT provide suggestions, explanations, commentary, or alternate versions.**
- **Do NOT prefix, number, or wrap your output in any way.**
- **If the original dialogue is already fitting, return it unchanged.**
- **Do not add narrative descriptions, actions, or extra text. Only output the final dialogue line, nothing else.**
- **IMPORTANT: You MUST use multiple sentences if the response exceeds 10 words. The first sentence in your response must be no more than 10 words.**
- **CRITICAL: You MUST preserve the intent behind the Original Dialogue.**
