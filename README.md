# SkyrimNet

## Overview

SkyrimNet is a cutting-edge AI integration platform for games, beginning with Skyrim. Unlike other AI projects that take an external server approach, SkyrimNet uses an **in-process design as a DLL** without requiring WSL or external servers. This architectural difference offers faster response times, lower system load, and a streamlined setup process.

**The most advanced AI platform for gaming - transforming every NPC into a living, breathing character with their own memories, goals, and personalities.**

## 🏗️ Revolutionary Architecture

### ⚡ **In-Process AI Stack**
- **In-Process Design**: Everything runs within the game's DLL - no external server or WSL required
- **High Performance**: Fast response times and efficient system resource usage
- **Direct Memory Access**: Reads game state directly from memory instead of syncing to external systems
- **Simplified Setup**: Straightforward installation without server configuration
- **Real-time Responsiveness**: Improved freshness of data and responsive AI behavior


## 🚀 **Installation & Setup**

### 📥 **Choose Your Build**
- **CUDA Build**: Maximum performance for NVIDIA users with in-process Whisper

### ⚙️ **Quick Start**
1. **Download** from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/MinLL/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/releases)
   
   **Piper TTS Models (Optional)**: If you plan to use Piper TTS, download the required voice models from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zmBJCLlaGWKBW8Z87rw2MiaNE-8cdSlv/view) and install them as a separate mod in your mod manager (MO2, Vortex, etc.).

2. **Install** using your preferred mod manager
3. **Enable** SkyrimNet.esp in your load order
4. **Launch** via SKSE and visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
5. **Complete** the guided setup wizard with your API keys
6. **Experience** the future of gaming AI!

*First launch automatically generates default configurations for your system.*

## 📋 **System Requirements**

### 🔧 **Essential Dependencies**
- [Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE)](https://skse.silverlock.org/)
- [Address Library for SKSE Plugins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444)
- [PowerOfThree's Papyrus Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22854)
- [PapyrusUtil SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13048)
- [Latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)
- [Native EditorID Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85260) ([VR version](https://github.com/naitro2010/NativeEditorIDFixNG/releases/))
  
### 🚀 **CUDA Build Requirements** *(For Maximum Performance)*
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
- [CUDA Toolkit 12.x](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-9-1-download-archive) - **IMPORTANT**: If using the CUDA build, SkyrimNet will not load without this!

### 📋 **Optional Dependencies**
- [UIExtensions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17561) - Required for text input and Input Wheel
- [Dragonborn Voice Over](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/84329) - Required for voicing player-selected lines in dialogue menus and the Silent NPC TTS feature, which voices otherwise silent NPC lines from other mods. To enable these features, install DBVO but disable or delete the DBVO.esp file (no voice pack is required). SkyrimNet will then capture dialogue events from the DBVO interface file and send them to TTS, allowing the player character and/or NPCs to speak normally silent lines.

### 🎮 **Version-Specific Requirements**

**Skyrim SE (without ESL support):**
- [Backported Extended ESL Support (BEES)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441)

**Skyrim VR:**
- [Skyrim VR ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106712) - Use instead of BEES


*⚠️ Important: CUDA Toolkit is required for the CUDA build to load properly*

### 🌐 **External API Requirements**
- **LLM Provider**: OpenRouter API key (or compatible OpenAI API)
- **Cloud Processing**: VastAI account (optional, for cloud GPU access and automatic XTTS provisioning)

## 🎪 Key Features

### 🧠 **AI Capabilities**
- **Dynamic NPC Interactions**: NPCs can react to player actions, world events, and conversations in real-time
- **Contextual Awareness**: The system maintains knowledge of recent events and uses this to inform AI responses
- **Smart NPC Selection**: Uses targeted fast LLM prompts to determine which NPC should react to events
- **Streaming Responses**: Supports streaming LLM responses for much faster responses and more natural conversation flow
- **Multi-Modal Processing**: Use the best LLM for the job. Different usecases are split out to different LLM's, allowing you to use a wider range of LLM's that were previously unsuitable
- **Semantic Understanding**: Advanced embedding models for natural conversation flow

### 🎭 **Living Character System**
- **3,000+ Unique Personalities**: Every vanilla NPC plus popular mod characters with detailed backstories
- **Dynamic Relationships**: Characters remember interactions, form opinions, and develop connections
- **Goal-Oriented Behavior**: NPCs pursue personal objectives, react to successes/failures
- **Emergent Conversations**: Characters naturally discuss events, gossip, and share knowledge

### 🧠 **Advanced Memory Architecture**
- **Per-Character Memories**: Memories are created from a first-person, per-character perspective. Every character remembers events differently based upon their personality and perspective.
- **Vector-Based Recall**: Semantic similarity matching for contextually relevant memories
- **Importance Weighting**: Critical events are remembered longer and influence behavior more
- **Temporal Decay**: Natural forgetting patterns that mirror human memory
- **Memory Consolidation**: Background processing creates long-term behavioral patterns

### 👁️ **Intelligent Awareness System**
- **Realistic Perception**: NPCs only know what they can see, hear, or reasonably infer. People from "downstairs" will not hear or react to your conversations.
- **Spatial Intelligence**: Distance, obstacles, and environmental factors affect interactions
- **Combat Awareness**: Dynamic reactions to threats, allies, and changing battle conditions
- **Social Context**: Understanding of relationships, hierarchies, and appropriate responses
- **Privacy Respect**: Private conversations stay private unless realistically overheard

### 🎙️ **Multi-Modal Communication**

## 🔧 **Built for Innovation**

### 🎯 **Modder-Friendly Architecture**
- **Extensible API**: Powerful Papyrus API for creating custom behaviors and actions. Creating new mods generally follows normal Skyrim modding paradigms.
- **Hot-Reloading**: Modify prompts, configs, and see changes instantly
- **Template Engine**: Powerful Inja-based prompt system with advanced features
- **Event Hooks**: React to any game event with custom AI behaviors

## ⚠️ **Current Limitations**

- **Available Actions**: The default list of actions that is exposed is rather limited at the moment. This will be expanded substantively in the future.
- **VR Keybinds**: At present, VR users cannot bind their controller buttons directly to hotkeys. VR users can use [this](https://github.com/BOLL7708/OpenVR2Key) as a workaround for the time being.

## 🚀 **Future Plans**

- **Expanded Actions**: More actions for NPC's to use.
- **Dynamic Quests**: Start and progress (some) quests automatically. Construct meaningful story arcs via automatic quest assignment. Handle things like "Meet me at the tavern later" via this system.
- **Dialogue Tree Analysis and Integration**: Analyze and Integrate with the existing normal "dialogue trees" to expose selection through natural dialogue, and improve profile generation.
- **Improve VR Support**: Fix the VR Keybind thing, and make VR a first class citizen. It already works quite well in VR aside from the hotkeys, for which there is a workaround.
- **Image to Text**: Add a sophisticated ITT pipeline that introduces meaningful context for the LLM.
- **Much, much more**
